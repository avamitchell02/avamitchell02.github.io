        <h2>Denison University Class of 2024: Data Analytics</h2>
        <p>My name is Ava Mitchell. I am originally from Detroit, Michigan, but am currently a student at Denison University studying Data Analytics and French. At Denison, I am an employee at the university's library, where I am an E-resource student assistant. I also work for Denison's Academic Resource Center as a French tutor. I am also a member of Denison's first Student Employment Advisory Council.</p>
        <p>When I am not at Denison, I love spending time with my family, friends, and dog. Some of my favorite things to do include watching movies, shopping with my brother, driving around, listening to music and exploring new places. A few fun more facts about me: I am left-handed, I am a vegetarian, and I have a total of seven ear piercings. </p>
